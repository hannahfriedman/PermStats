# PermStats

This folder provides computational verification and background for some of the results in our paper on compression of permutation statistics.

convolve_w_ij: provides evidence for result describing the convolution of w_ij functions.

decompression: provides evidence for w_ij decompression formula.

dft: generates matrices in Discrete Fourier Transform of permutation statistics.

random_walk: contains code that generates images of plotted variation distance in paper.
